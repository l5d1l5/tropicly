  abstract = {Global land cover maps are a vital source for mapping our globe into a set of thematic types. They have
been extensively used as a basis layer for a large number of applications including ecosystem services,
environmental planning, climate change, hydrological processes and policy making. While regional land
cover maps for some areas such as Europe and North America has been greatly developed and very few
temporal datasets exist, lack of such data for some regions specifically developing countries is evident.
Although it seems global land cover maps such as MODIS could be a solution for mapping these regions,
their coarse spatial resolution e.g., 500 m as well as their accuracy are very challenging. Recently,
GlobeLand30 a global land cover with a relatively fine resolution at 30 m extracted from Landsat images
has been released, which seems to be a potential dataset for mapping areas with limited land cover
information such as developing countries. In this study, we look at GlobeLand30 of 2010 for Iran in order
to find out the accuracy of this dataset as well as its implications. By having looked at 6 selected study
sites around larger cities representing dissimilar eco-regions covering rural and urban areas, we conclude
that the overall accuracy of GlobeLand30 with 77.9% was satisfactory for entire Iran. We also define six
representative eco-regions dominated by diverse land type mixtures considering the administrative
boundaries. The detailed implications of this dataset for developing different applications as well as
informing regional policy makers are discussed.},

  abstract = {Global land cover (LC) maps have been widely employed as the base layer
for a number of applications including climate change, food security, water
quality, biodiversity, change detection, and environmental planning. Due
to the importance of LC, there is a pressing need to increase the
temporal and spatial resolution of global LC maps. A recent advance in
this direction has been the GlobeLand30 dataset derived from Landsat
imagery, which has been developed by the National Geomatics Center
of China (NGCC). Although overall accuracy is greater than 80%, the
NGCC would like help in assessing the accuracy of the product in
different regions of the world. To assist in this process, this study
compares the GlobeLand30 product with existing public and online
datasets, that is, CORINE, Urban Atlas (UA), OpenStreetMap, and ATKIS
for Germany in order to assess overall and per class agreement. The
results of the analysis reveal high agreement of up to 92% between
these datasets and GlobeLand30 but that large disagreements for
certain classes are evident, in particular wetlands. However, overall,
GlobeLand30 is shown to be a useful product for characterizing LC in
Germany, and paves the way for further regional and national validation
efforts.},

In comparison, selective logging has been mostly invisible to satellites. We
developed a large-scale, high-resolution, automated remote-sensing analysis
of selective logging in the top five timber-producing states of the Brazilian
Amazon. Logged areas ranged from 12,075 to 19,823 square kilometers per
year (T14%) between 1999 and 2002, equivalent to 60 to 123% of previously
reported deforestation area. Up to 1200 square kilometers per year of logging
were observed on conservation lands. Each year, 27 million to 50 million cubic
meters of wood were extracted, and a gross flux of {{\`{E}}}0.1 billion metric tons of
carbon was destined for release to the atmosphere by logging.},

Vu Gia Thu Bon River Basin, Central Vietnam, were estimated using Landsat satellite images and
3083 forest inventory plots. The net emissions from above- and belowground vegetation
biomass were equal to 1.76 {{\S}} 0.12 Tg CO 2 , about 1.1% of the existing stocks. The vast majority
of carbon emissions were due to forest loss, with the conversion of forest to cropland
accounting for 67% of net emissions. Forest regrowth had a substantial impact on net carbon
changes, removing 22% of emissions from deforestation. Most deforestation occurred in
regrowth forest (60%) and plantations (2\%), characterized by low carbon stock density. Thus
identifying the type of forest where deforestation occurred and using local field data were
critical with net emissions being 4 times larger when considering only one forest class with
average carbon stock, and 5--7 times higher when using literature default values or global
emission maps. Carbon emissions from soil (up to 30 cm) were estimated for the main land
change class. Due to the low emission factors from biomass, soils proved a key emission
category, accounting for 30% of total land emissions that occurred during the monitoring
period.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents concepts that motivate the use of hexagon mosaic maps and hexagon-based
ray-glyph maps. The phrase "hexagon mosaic map" refers to maps that use hexagons to tessellate major areas
of a map, such as land masses. Hexagon mosaic maps are similar to color-contour (isarithm) maps and show
broad regional patterns. The ray glyph, an oriented line segment with a dot at the base, provides a convenient
symbol for representing information within a hexagon cell. Ray angle encodes the local estimate for the hexagon.
A simple extension adds upper- and lower-confidence bounds as a shaded arc bounded by two rays. Another
extension, the bivariate ray glyph, provides a continuous representation for showing the local correlation of two
variables. The theme of integrating statistical analysis and cartographic methods appears throughout this paper.
Example maps show statistical summaries of acidic deposition data for the eastern United States. These maps
provide useful templates for a wide range of statistical summarization and exploration tasks. Correspondingly,
the concepts in this paper address the incorporation of statistical information, visual appeal, representational
accuracy, and map interpretation.},

  abstract  = {The expansion of built environment is a major driver of land change which can have irreversible
consequences on the environment, ecosystem services, and biodiversity. While most studies have
focused on urban areas, particularly large cities, the built environment includes much more. This is
exemplified by the complex interconnection among cities of all sizes and rural areas through trade,
people, policies, and infrastructure, which ultimately shapes the patterns of land use. However, a
comprehensive spatial analysis of built-up areas is lacking. Here, we used nighttime data to evaluate
the extent and spatial distribution of the built environment across the South American continent
between 2001 and 2011, with the objectives of determining where built-up expansion is occurring and
the relative contribution of the 30 major cities with populations greater than 1 million people. Our
results reveal that built-up expansion occurs well beyond the 30 major cities, with the majority of
expansion occurring in small and medium cities and rural areas. This detailed and spatially explicit
description of development patterns across South America provides a valuable baseline for land use
policies, which hopefully will balance future built expansion with the need for agriculture lands and
the protection of large uninterrupted natural areas.},

period 1990--2000--2010 and provides an overview on the main drivers of forest cover
change. A systematic sample of 418 sites (10 km $\times$ 10 km size) located at the one-
degree geographical confluence points and covered with satellite imagery of 30 m res-
olution is used for the assessment. Techniques of image segmentation and automated
classification are combined with visual satellite image interpretation and quality con-
trol, involving forestry experts from Southeast Asian countries. The accuracy of our
results is assessed through an independent consistency assessment, performed from
a subsample of 1572 mapping units and resulting in an overall agreement of > 85 %
for the general differentiation of forest cover vs. non-forest cover. The total forest cover
of Southeast Asia is estimated at 268 Mha in 1990, dropping to 236 Mha in 2010, with
annual change rates of 1.75 Mha ($\sim$ 0.67 %) and 1.45 Mha ($\sim$ 0.59 %) for the periods
1990--2000 and 2000--2010, respectively. The vast majority of forest cover loss ($\sim$ 2/3
for 2000--2010) occurred in insular Southeast Asia. Combining the change patterns
visible from satellite imagery with the output of an expert consultation on the main
drivers of forest change highlights the high pressure on the region{\textquoteright}s remaining forests.
The conversion of forest cover to cash crop plantations (e.g. oil palm) is ranked as the
dominant driver of forest change in Southeast Asia, followed by selective logging and
the establishment of tree plantations.},

  abstract  = {The continuous rise in the global demand for palm oil has resulted in large-scale expansion of
industrial oil palm plantations---largely at the expense of primary and secondary forests. The
potentially negative environmental impacts of these conversions have given rise to closer scrutiny.
However, empirical data on the effects of conversion of forests to industrial oil palm plantations on
soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is scarce and patchy. We evaluated the changes in SOC stocks after
conversion of tropical forest into oil palm plantations over the first and second rotation period in
Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. Soil samples were collected from three age classes of oil palm plantations
converted from forest (49, 39 and 29 years ago respectively) with three replicate sites and four adjacent
primary forest sites as reference. In each site under oil palm, the three management zones, namely
weeded circle (WC), frond stacks (FS), and between palm (BP), were sampled separately. All soil
samples were collected from five soil layers (0--5, 5--15, 15--30, 30--50 and 50--70 cm). Samples were
analysed for SOC concentration, soil bulk density, pH and soil texture. Results showed SOC stocks
declined by 42%, 24% and 18% after 29, 39 and 49 years of conversion respectively. Significant
differences in SOC stocks were found among different management zones in the oil palm plantations,
and the trend was similar for all age classes: FS>WC>BP, demonstrating the necessity of
considering within-plantation variability when assessing soil C stocks. The largest differences between
SOC stocks of the reference forest and converted plantations were found in the topsoil (0--15 cm
depth) but differences were also found in the subsoil (>30 cm). Our results will contribute towards
future modelling and life cycle accounting to calculate the carbon debt from the conversion of forest to
oil palm plantations.},

  journal  = {Science Advances},

  volume   = {3},
  abstract = {An intact forest landscape (IFL) is a seamless mosaic of forest and naturally treeless ecosystems with no remote-
ly detected signs of human activity and a minimum area of 500 km 2 . IFLs are critical for stabilizing terrestrial
carbon storage, harboring biodiversity, regulating hydrological regimes, and providing other ecosystem
functions. Although the remaining IFLs comprise only 20% of tropical forest area, they account for 40% of
the total aboveground tropical forest carbon. We show that global IFL extent has been reduced by 7.2% since
the year 2000. An increasing rate of global IFL area reduction was found, largely driven by the tripling of IFL
tropical forest loss in 2011--2013 compared to that in 2001--2003. Industrial logging, agricultural expansion, fire,
and mining/resource extraction were the primary causes of IFL area reduction. Protected areas (International
Union for Conservation of Nature categories I to III) were found to have a positive effect in slowing the reduc-
tion of IFL area from timber harvesting but were less effective in limiting agricultural expansion. The certifica-
tion of logging concessions under responsible management had a negligible impact on slowing IFL
fragmentation in the Congo Basin. Fragmentation of IFLs by logging and establishment of roads and other
infrastructure initiates a cascade of changes that lead to landscape transformation and loss of conservation
values. Given that only 12% of the global IFL area is protected, our results illustrate the need for planning
and investment in carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation efforts that target the most valuable
remaining forests, as identified using the IFL approach.},

  year      = {2015},
  volume    = {10},
  abstract  = {Land use change in South America, mainly deforestation, is a large source of anthropogenic CO 2
emissions. Identifying and addressing the causes or drivers of anthropogenic forest change is
considered crucial for global climate change mitigation. Few countries however, monitor deforesta-
tion drivers in a systematic manner. National-level quantitative spatially explicit information on
drivers is often lacking. This study quantifies proximate drivers of deforestation and related carbon
losses in South America based on remote sensing time series in a systematic, spatially explicit manner.
Deforestation areas were derived from the 2010 global remote sensing survey of the Food and
Agricultural Organisation Forest Resource Assessment. To assess proximate drivers, land use
following deforestation was assigned by visual interpretation of high-resolution satellite imagery. To
estimate gross carbon losses from deforestation, default Tier 1 biomass levels per country and eco-
zone were used. Pasture was the dominant driver of forest area (71.2%) and related carbon loss
(71.6%) in South America, followed by commercial cropland (14% and 12.1% respectively). Hotspots
of deforestation due to pasture occurred in Northern Argentina, Western Paraguay, and along the arc
of deforestation in Brazil where they gradually moved into higher biomass forests causing additional
carbon losses. Deforestation driven by commercial cropland increased in time, with hotspots
occurring in Brazil (Mato Grosso State), Northern Argentina, Eastern Paraguay and Central Bolivia.
Infrastructure, such as urban expansion and roads, contributed little as proximate drivers of forest
area loss (1.7%). Our findings contribute to the understanding of drivers of deforestation and related
carbon losses in South America, and are comparable at the national, regional and continental level. In
addition, they support the development of national REDD+ interventions and forest monitoring
systems, and provide valuable input for statistical analysis and modelling of underlying drivers of
deforestation.},

to clip out the portions of a polygon that lie outside the window of the output device to prevent undesirable effects. In the recent past polygon clipping is used to render 3D images through hidden surface removal [9, 11] and to produce high-quality surface details using techniques such as Beam tracing [3]. Polygon dipping is also used in distributing the objects of a scene to appropriate processors in multiprocessor raytracing systems to improve rendering speeds [1]. Clipping an arbitrary polygon against an arbitrary polygon has been a complex task. The existing solutions for polygon clipping are either limited to certain types of polygons or tend to be very complex and time consuming.},

reforestation may cause additional soil disturbance by affecting soil temperature and moisture, thus

methods on soil CO 2 flux after clear-cutting in a Chinese fir plantation in subtropical China: uncut (UC),
clear-cut followed by coppicing regeneration without soil preparation (CC), clear-cut followed by
coppicing regeneration and reforestation with soil preparation, tending in pits and replanting (CCR P ), and
clear-cut followed by coppicing regeneration and reforestation with overall soil preparation, tending and
replanting (CCR O ). Clear-cutting significantly increased the mean soil temperature and decreased the
mean soil moisture. Compared to UC, CO 2 fluxes were 19.19, 37.49 and 55.93 mg m 2 h 1 higher in CC,
CCR P and CCR O , respectively (P < 0.05). Differences in CO 2 fluxes were mainly attributed to changes in soil
temperature, litter mass and the mixing of organic matter with mineral soil. The results suggest that,
when compared to coppicing regeneration, reforestation practices result in additional CO 2 released, and
that regarding the CO 2 emissions, soil preparation and tending in pits is a better choice than overall soil
preparation and tending.},

Only some of these are able to recover unaided.
Where attempts are being made to restore such for-

plantations are one of the few means by which large
areas of cleared or degraded landscape can be refor-
ested. These usually restore the productive capacity of
the landscape but do little to recover biological diver-
sity. But a number of approaches might be used to re-
design such plantations so that they would both yield
the timber needed to justify the investment and also
contain some proportion of their former biodiversity.
These approaches include using indigenous species
rather than exotic species, creating species mosaics by
matching species to particular sites, embedding the
plantation monocultures in a matrix of intact or re-
stored vegetation, using species mixtures rather than
monocultures, or encouraging the diverse plant un-
derstories that can often develop beneath plantations.
The degree of ecological restoration possible using
these alternatives ranges from modest to significant, al-
though none is likely to achieve complete restoration.
Any improvements in regional biodiversity brought
about by these changes might be seen as being at the
expense of plantation productivity. But many of these
approaches have advantages other than just restoring
former biodiversity. I discuss some of the trade-offs},

  abstract  = {Oil palm and rubber expansion is a main driver of the widespread deforestation of tropical rainforests taking
place in South-East Asia, particularly in Indonesia. The replacement of forests with monoculture plantations of
rubber and oil palm reduces biodiversity and carbon pools but also modifies canopy structure, which is an
important determinant of microclimate. There is, however, a lack of quantitative information characterizing the
effect of such land transformation on microclimate. We report the first medium-term observations of below-
canopy microclimatic conditions (air temperature, relative humidity, vapour pressure deficit and soil tem-
perature) across forest, jungle rubber agroforest, oil palm and rubber monoculture plantations in Sumatra/
Indonesia. The data set covers a period of approximately three years (2013--2016) and includes one of the
strongest El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillations (ENSO) of the last decades. Forests were up to 2.3 and 2.2 {$^{\circ}$}C cooler than
oil palm and rubber monocultures respectively. The monocultures were also drier (11.9% and 12.8% less in oil
palm and rubber respectively) and had higher vapour pressure deficit (632 Pa and 665 Pa higher in oil palm and
rubber respectively) than the forest, while differences in soil temperature were less pronounced. Conversion
from forest to other land uses, especially to monocultures, also amplified the diurnal range of all microclimatic
variables studied. Jungle rubber stands out as the transformed land-use system that maintains more stable
microclimatic conditions. Our results indicate that canopy openness is a key driver of below-canopy micro-
climate, and hence could be used in climate models to better evaluate climatic feedbacks of land-use change to
rubber and oil palm. The ENSO event of 2015 led to warmer and drier conditions than in the previous two years
in all four land-use systems, especially in the forest (up to 2.3 {$^{\circ}$}C warmer, 8.9% drier and up to 351 Pa more
during ENSO). The relative effect of ENSO was lower in the monoculture plantations, where below-canopy
microclimate is generally more similar to open areas. Forests exhibited the largest differences with the pre-ENSO
years, but still maintained more stable microclimatic conditions (lower temperatures and vapour pressure deficit
and higher relative humidity) due to their higher climate regulation capacity. During ENSO, microclimatic
conditions in jungle rubber were comparable to those in the monocultures, suggesting that while forests buffered
the increase of temperature, jungle rubber might have surpassed its buffering capacity to extreme events. This
capacity of buffering extreme climatic events should be considered when assessing the effects of land-use change.},
