  abstract = {Global land cover maps are a vital source for mapping our globe into a set of thematic types. They have
been extensively used as a basis layer for a large number of applications including ecosystem services,
environmental planning, climate change, hydrological processes and policy making. While regional land
cover maps for some areas such as Europe and North America has been greatly developed and very few
temporal datasets exist, lack of such data for some regions specifically developing countries is evident.
Although it seems global land cover maps such as MODIS could be a solution for mapping these regions,
their coarse spatial resolution e.g., 500 m as well as their accuracy are very challenging. Recently,
GlobeLand30 a global land cover with a relatively fine resolution at 30 m extracted from Landsat images
has been released, which seems to be a potential dataset for mapping areas with limited land cover
information such as developing countries. In this study, we look at GlobeLand30 of 2010 for Iran in order
to find out the accuracy of this dataset as well as its implications. By having looked at 6 selected study
sites around larger cities representing dissimilar eco-regions covering rural and urban areas, we conclude
that the overall accuracy of GlobeLand30 with 77.9% was satisfactory for entire Iran. We also define six
representative eco-regions dominated by diverse land type mixtures considering the administrative
boundaries. The detailed implications of this dataset for developing different applications as well as
informing regional policy makers are discussed.},

  abstract      = {Global land cover (LC) maps have been widely employed as the base layer
for a number of applications including climate change, food security, water
quality, biodiversity, change detection, and environmental planning. Due
to the importance of LC, there is a pressing need to increase the
temporal and spatial resolution of global LC maps. A recent advance in
this direction has been the GlobeLand30 dataset derived from Landsat
imagery, which has been developed by the National Geomatics Center
of China (NGCC). Although overall accuracy is greater than 80%, the
NGCC would like help in assessing the accuracy of the product in
different regions of the world. To assist in this process, this study
compares the GlobeLand30 product with existing public and online
datasets, that is, CORINE, Urban Atlas (UA), OpenStreetMap, and ATKIS
for Germany in order to assess overall and per class agreement. The
results of the analysis reveal high agreement of up to 92% between
these datasets and GlobeLand30 but that large disagreements for
certain classes are evident, in particular wetlands. However, overall,
GlobeLand30 is shown to be a useful product for characterizing LC in
Germany, and paves the way for further regional and national validation
efforts.},

  volume   = {3},
  abstract = {An intact forest landscape (IFL) is a seamless mosaic of forest and naturally treeless ecosystems with no remote-
ly detected signs of human activity and a minimum area of 500 km 2 . IFLs are critical for stabilizing terrestrial
carbon storage, harboring biodiversity, regulating hydrological regimes, and providing other ecosystem
functions. Although the remaining IFLs comprise only 20% of tropical forest area, they account for 40% of
the total aboveground tropical forest carbon. We show that global IFL extent has been reduced by 7.2% since
the year 2000. An increasing rate of global IFL area reduction was found, largely driven by the tripling of IFL
tropical forest loss in 2011--2013 compared to that in 2001--2003. Industrial logging, agricultural expansion, fire,
and mining/resource extraction were the primary causes of IFL area reduction. Protected areas (International
Union for Conservation of Nature categories I to III) were found to have a positive effect in slowing the reduc-
tion of IFL area from timber harvesting but were less effective in limiting agricultural expansion. The certifica-
tion of logging concessions under responsible management had a negligible impact on slowing IFL
fragmentation in the Congo Basin. Fragmentation of IFLs by logging and establishment of roads and other
infrastructure initiates a cascade of changes that lead to landscape transformation and loss of conservation
values. Given that only 12% of the global IFL area is protected, our results illustrate the need for planning
and investment in carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation efforts that target the most valuable
remaining forests, as identified using the IFL approach.},
