	\begin{itemize}
		\item Our study shows that agriculture is the largest deforestation driver in the tropical zone.
		\item Whereby the agricultural type differs for the continents.
		\item Further we developed an approach which build on readily available data.
		\item Our results show that it can be applicable to aggregate the already available datasets for scientific reasoning.
		\item This reduces the large effort for remote sensing on global scale if applied carefully.
		\item During this study we experimented with the tree cover agreement and developed a method to harmonize the tree cover agreement between datasets

% Solve todos in each chapter

%Short selling points:
%Improve gap spatially-explicit
%	Openly available scripts to reproduce and build on existing work
%	this represents to the best of our knowledge one of the few global analysis in this field (with the exception of Curtis)
%Highlight regional differences of proximate drivers across continents?
%Highlight major country contributors to deforestation?
%Future research identified?
