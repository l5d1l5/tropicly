\textbf{Title: Tropical deforestation and its impact on land cover, carbon losses, and ecosystem service values}

\begin{itemize}
	\item This study analyzes spatial explicitly the magnitudes of proximate deforestation driver, the related carbon losses by removal of biomass and soil organic carbon changes, and the ecosystem service value dynamics of tropical forest cover loss between 2001 and 2010.
	\item By applying the most recent global land cover datasets GlobeLand30 and Global Forest Change we quantified the proximate deforestation driver.
	\item We harmonized the datasets by applying the jaccard index.
	\item Two biomass maps are used to derive the carbon losses.
	\item To assess deforestation impacts on the ecosystem service dynamics the unit values from the three most common datasets are used.
	\item The harmonization revealed that tree cover agreement between both land cover is at its maximum within the canopy density interval $(10,100]$, while continental agreement differs in its interval.
	\item On global scale agriculture (79.7\%) is the most dominant deforestation driver, while the expansion of pastures contributed most (33.1\%).
	\item The continental scaled analysis revealed that proximate driver dynamics differ.
	\item In Latin America and Africa the expansion of pastures is the major driver, while Asia/Australia is dominated by regrowth dynamics.
	\item On the global scale
