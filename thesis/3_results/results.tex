		\subsection{Forest definition}
		\label{subsec:results_forest_definition}
			Our goal is to determine at which canopy cover density the agreement between \ac{GL30} and \ac{GFC} tree cover is greatest to receive the subsequent \ac{PDD} for stable \ac{LC} transitions introduced by anthropogenic causes. This process should ensure that we keep the largest number of tree cover loss samples from the \ac{GFC} dataset while harmonizing the tree cover definition between both layers. We applied the \ac{JI} to determine the similarity between each tile pair from our \ac{AISM}. The \ac{JI} computation is grouped by the continental regions Latin America (82 tiles), Asia/Australia (86 tiles), and Africa (101 tiles). We determined the similarity for the following canopy density intervals: $(0, 100]$, $(10, 100]$, $(20, 100]$, and $(30, 100]$. Later we excluded all tiles with a initial \ac{JI} (canopy density interval $(0,100]$) from our analysis because these tile pair does not contain any tree cover. We excluded 6, 9, and 15 tiles for Latin America, Asia/Australia and Africa, respectively. To determine the canopy density interval where the agreement is at maximum we applied the non-parametric tests Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Both of the tests are performed as a one- and two-sided to deduce, if there is a difference in agreement (equality) and which direction (less or greater) has this difference. To address the higher probability of family-wise error rate in multiple comparisons we applied a Holm correction for Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and a Benjamini and Hochberg correction for Wilcoxon rank-sum test. We applied continental and global testing to deduce regional differences and to determine the optimum for our subsequent \ac{PDD} predictions. Further, we compared the tree cover agreement of the three continental regions. Our initial hypothesis was that the tree cover agreement is at its maximum within the canopy density interval of $(30,100]$ for the entire study extent. We assumed that for Latin America and Asia/Australia the best results could be achieved with the same canopy density threshold. For Africa we assumed that the highest agreement could be achieved within the interval of $(10,100]$ because this region comprises a higher frequency of sparse woodland cover. The following paragraphs present our results for the three regions in the following order: Latin America, Asia/Australia and Africa. The last paragraph discusses the results for the entire study extent and determines which canopy density we used for the following \ac{PDD} prediction.

			For Latin America, Asia/Australia and Africa as well the entire study extent figure \ref{fig:jaccard} shows the distribution of the computed \acp{JI} for all tile pairs within the canopy density intervals. The x-axis are the different canopy density intervals where the label $JI_0$ accounts for $(0,100]$, $JI_1$ $(10,100]$, $JI_2$ $(20,100]$, and $JI_3$ $(30,100]$, respectively. The y-axis is the corresponding \ac{JI} between 0 and 1 where 0 highlights a complete disagreement and 1 a full agreement. The sample mean is labelled by a red cross and the boxes comprises the $Q_1$ (25 \%), $Q_2$ (50 \%), and $Q_3$ (75 \%) sample interval, respectively.

			For Latin America the sample mean does not change significantly within the four canopy density experiments. It is approximately 0.62 while sample median decreases from 0.68 to 0.66 from the interval class to the last. The upper 25 \% of the first experiment interval have a tree cover similarity ranging between approximately 0.8 and 1. This holds true over the other three experiments while only the maximum similarity slightly increases from 0.9787 to 0.9798. The figure \ref{fig:jaccard_americas_appendix} in the appendix \ref{ch:appendix_b} suggests, that exclusions of canopy densities smaller than 11\% increases slightly the tree cover agreement of the upper 25\% but the exclusion of higher canopy density provides no benefit. This can be explained by the fact that the upper percentile already contain samples with a high tree cover agreement and it is to assume that only a small number of pixels have canopy density smaller than 30. Therefore, the interval change has only a small impact on this samples. For the first two canopy density intervals the range of the lower 25\% percentile is between approximately 0.0003 and 0.45. Whereas the range increases from 0.0 to 0.5 for the last two interval classes. The figure \ref{fig:jaccard_americas_appendix} reveals a strong regional dependency of tree cover agreement within different canopy density classes of the lower percentiles. Whereas samples from the northern hemisphere show a decline in agreement the samples of the southern hemisphere show a increase of agreement. The strong up-shift of the southern samples within the last two intervals increases the range of lower percentile. This suggests in general that samples with low tree cover agreement benefit by the exclusion of lower canopy densities. The mobility of the samples within the $Q_1$ and $Q_3$ percentile show no general trend. For the first two experiments it ranges between 0.5 and 0.8 and for the last two it shows a small decline in $IQR$. This suggests that tiles within this group could benefit from a local optimization of canopy density exclusion. We applied a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to deduce which canopy density class yields the highest tree cover agreement overall samples in Latin America. Table \ref{tab:wilcoxontwosided_regions} shows the results for the two-sided test and table \ref{tab:wilcoxontwosided_regions} for the one-sided test. The two-sided test reveals that only the similarity distribution between $JI_0$ and $JI_1$ is significantly different ($p<0.01$), while the comparison of the other distributions suggest that they are equal. The directional test of $JI_0$ and $JI_1$ suggests that the regional tree cover agreement is significantly greater ($p<0.005$) if canopy densities smaller than 10 are excluded. The directional test does not confirm that the distribution if $JI_1$ is significantly greater than $JI_2$ and $JI_3$. Therefore it can be assumed that the exclusion of lower canopy densities could yield better results for certain tiles. The result of our experiments suggests that the tree cover agreement between \ac{GL30} and \ac{GFC} at canopy densities greater than 10 is at its maximum for Latin America. In case of local studies or for smaller extents the canopy density should be selected by a single tile approach to optimize the tree cover agreement by maximizing the number of data points of the \ac{GFC} dataset.

			For Asia/Australia, the sample mean scatters around 0.7 as the red crosses in figure \ref{fig:jaccard} suggest. The sample mean decreases slightly at higher canopy density intervals. Further, the median is approximately 0.8 by showing a slight decrease at higher canopy density intervals too. The range of the upper percentiles for all experiments groups is between approximately 0.85 and 0.96 while the maximum agreement decreases slightly from 0.9654 to 0.9634. Figure \ref{fig:jaccard_asia_appendix} in the appendix \ref{ch:appendix_b}, reveals that in general the tree cover agreement increases if canopy densities below 10 \% are excluded but the exclusion of densities above 20 \% reverts this. For Asia/Australia the lower percentile ranges between approximately 0 and 0.65 while most of the samples show a decline in tree cover agreement if canopy densities above 20 are excluded. Within the $Q_1,3$ percentile a per tile relationship is detectable. The range of this percentile is between 0.65 and 0.85 for the first two classes $JI_0$ and $JI_1$ while the range increases for the last two experiments. As mentioned no clear trend is observable some of the samples benefit if the considered canopy density interval is increased till 30 \% and some show a decrease in agreement if the canopy density is lift over 10 \%. The two-sided Wilcoxon test in table \ref{tab:wilcoxontwosided_regions} reveals that the similarity distribution is significantly different (p<0.01) between each experiment group except the pair of $JI_1$ and $JI_0$. The directional test in table \ref{tab:wilcoxononesided_regions} reveals that the tree cover agreement distributions of $JI_2$ and $JI_3$ are significantly smaller than $JI_0$ and $JI_1$ (p<0.005). Further this results show that the distributions of $JI_0$ and $JI_1$ have no directional differences. This could be explained by a regional or tile-wise agreement component. While some of the tiles show strong increase in similarity if canopy density is set to 10 \%, others show a decrease. A more detailed analysis could be performed by applying a smaller canopy density step-size. For studies targeting the region Asia/Australia the results of the directional tests suggest to use all data from \ac{GFC} within the canopy density interval of $(0,100]$. While the figure \ref{fig:jaccard_asia_appendix} suggests to include all data form the interval $(10,100]$.

			The box-plot for Africa in figure \ref{fig:jaccard} shows that the similarity range of the upper 75 \% is the greatest among our study regions. It ranges between 0.15 and 1.0 for $JI_0$ while the range increases if smaller canopy densities are excluded. The first two experiment groups $JI_0$ and $JI_1$ have a nearly similar mean and median of approximately 0.38 and 0.4, respectively. Whereas both metrics show a strong decline to 0.33 and 0.3 in the last two experiment groups $JI_2$ and $JI_3$, respectively. Figure \ref{fig:jaccard_africa_appendix} in the appendix \ref{ch:appendix_b} reveals that the upper 25 \% different to Latin America and Asia not benefit in general by exclusion of lower canopy densities. Africa has the highest amount of tiles where there tree cover agreement is smaller than 0.1. For the second experiment group $JI_1$ 11 tiles from the \ac{AISM} have a complete disagreement ($JI=0$) if the canopy density interval is reduced to $(10,100]$. This trend continues if the canopy density interval is further reduced. This already suggests that reducing the canopy density interval for Africa is not feasible. The two-sided test in table \ref{tab:wilcoxontwosided_regions} reveals that $JI_3$ is significantly different ($p<0.01$) in its similarity distribution compared to the other experiment groups $JI_0$, $JI_1$, and $JI_2$, respectively. The other experiment groups could origin from the same similarity distribution. Especially, the tree cover agreement between $JI_0$ and $JI_1$ show evidences that it could origin from the same distribution. This is comparable with the Asia/Australian region. The table \ref{tab:wilcoxononesided_regions} shows the directional component of the tree cover agreement between the experiments groups for Africa. The tree cover agreement of $JI_2$ and $JI_3$ is significantly smaller than $JI_0$ or $JI_1$ as the table suggest. Therefore the exclusion of canopy densities above 10 \% reduces the continental tree cover agreement in Africa. For the two experiment groups $JI_0$ and $JI_1$ no directional agreement component could be proofed but the figure \ref{fig:jaccard_africa_appendix} shows a strong regional component of tree cover agreement. The strong regional component can be explained by the high share of sparse woodland in Africa. The figure \ref{fig:africa_tree_cover} in section \ref{subsec:results_tree_cover_and_deforestation} shows that different from Asia/Australia and Latin America a vast amount of African tree cover has a canopy density between 0 and 46 \%. The results for Africa suggests to set the canopy density interval to $(0,100]$ to optimize the tree cover agreement between \ac{GL30} and \ac{GFC} on a continental level. Preferable the strong regional component suggests to optimize the tree cover agreement per tile to achieve a higher tree cover agreement for the entire continent.

			The table \ref{tab:wilcoxononesided_comparison} in the appendix \ref{ch:appendix_b} shows that in Asia/Australia the tree cover similarity between \ac{GL30} and \ac{GFC} is the greatest out of all three regions. Only within the last experiment group $JI_3$ the median tree cover agreement between Asia/Australia and Latin America could be the same shown in table \ref{tab:wilcoxontwosided_comparison}. Africa has the poorest tree cover agreement out of our three continental regions. Asia's higher tree cover agreement compared to Latin America could relate to the smaller total landmass and vice versa forest cover within this region and the high share of dense forest cover. Therefore both global \ac{LC} datasets have a smaller chance to miss forest covered pixels. That both regions achieve better tree cover similarity as Africa could be explained by the high amount of dense forest cover within this regions. It could be assumed that the probability of misclassification of forest cover increases as lower the canopy density is. In regards of tile-wise tree cover agreement optimization would Africa benefit at most out of the three regions. In Asia/Australia and Latin America only certain tiles would benefit from a exclusive optimization as the figures \ref{fig:jaccard_americas_appendix} and \ref{fig:jaccard_asia_appendix} suggests.

			On the far right of figure \ref{fig:jaccard} the tree cover agreement of the entire study extent is shown. The sample mean and median differ between the first two experiment groups and the last two groups. For the first two groups the mean and median account for 0.56 and 0.63, respectively. The last two experiment groups show a decline to 0.53 and 0.53 for mean and median. For the upper percentile the same statement as for the regions holds true. In general, the samples with high tree cover agreement benefit from the exclusion of lower canopy densities. The lower percentile shows strong regional or tile-wise tree agreement dependencies. If we consider the entire sample range the mid percentile steadily increases its range from 0.4 to 0.8 till 0.3 to 0.8. As mentioned in the regional analysis, this percentile is characterized by inhomogeneous changes of tree cover agreement by the step-wise change of the canopy density. In general the trend points downwards as the decrease in median and the range increase show. The results of the two-sided Wilcoxon test in table \ref{tab:wilcoxontwosided_all} show a significant difference in distribution (p<0.02 and p<0.01) between each experiment group except $JI_0$ and $JI_2$ where the similarity distribution could be the same. Table \ref{tab:wilcoxononesided_all} highlights the directional component of these distribution differences. At a global scale the tree cover agreement is at its maximum if we set the canopy density interval to $(10,100]$. The second experiment group $JI_1$ is significantly greater than $JI_0$ (p<0.005) and the last two groups $JI_2$ and $JI_3$ are significantly smaller (p>0.005) than $JI_1$. Further, the tree cover agreement of $JI_0$ is significantly greater than (p<0.005 and p<0.05) $JI_2$ and $JI_3$. Therefore it is proved that canopy densities above 20 \% reduce the tree cover agreement between \ac{GL30} and \ac{GFC} on a global level. On a global scale as the analysis on tree cover agreement suggests the highest agreement can be achieved within the $JI_1$ interval. Therefore we decided to proceed for our study of \ac{PDD} and the derived products with this definition of tree cover.

		\subsection{Patterns of tree cover and deforestation}
		\label{subsec:results_tree_cover_and_deforestation}
			This section is intended to present a comprehensive insight in the tropical tree cover distribution within our study extent at 2000 over the tree continental regions. Further, we highlight at which sites the tree cover loss peaked between 2000 and 2010. The tree cover maps are derived from the \ac{GFC} tree cover 2000 layer while we selected only pixels within our forest definition which refers to the canopy density interval $(10,100]$. For an appropriate visualization of multivariate spatial data on a large extent we selected our hexagonal binning approach. For the tree cover maps we computed the total area covered by trees within a polygon and divide by the total area of the hexagon to determine the scaling. Additionally we aggregate the canopy density within a hexagon by applying the arithmetic mean. To arrange the tree cover loss maps we used our \ac{PDD} products. We computed the loss area within each hexagon for the following \ac{PDD} classes: cultivated land (10), regrowth (25), grassland (30), shrubland (40), artificial surfaces (80), and bareland (90). To determine the polygon scaling we divided the per hexagon loss area by the highest observed loss within a continental region. Forest cover, losses, and hexagon areas are computed by applying the Haversine equation. A hexagon in unscaled shape covers an area of 0.5 decimal degrees. The maps in this section should be interpreted as precursor to our \ac{PDD} predictions to detect regional and continental patterns of deforestation and as an example how large multivariate spatial data can be visualized and evaluated by a more advanced aggregation approach.

			The map in figure \ref{fig:americas_tree_cover} shows the tree cover and canopy density distribution within our study extent for Latin America at 2000. The center of the map is covered by the core tropical rain forest characterized by high tree cover per hexagon between approximately 39 and 49 thousand km$^2$ and a mean canopy density between 82 and 100 \%. The core rain forest zone is distributed over 9 Latin American countries, namely: Colombia, Venezuela, Guiana, Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. In Brazil, within the tropical core zone two hexagons are smaller scaled which highlights a tree cover between 29 and 39 thousand km$^2$ at a canopy density between 82 and 100 \%. These two hexagons comprising floodplain forest at the borders of the Amazon river located in the state Pará. This river basin enclosed by the three cities Santarém, Almeirim, and Óbidos suffered severe deforestation since the 16th century \citep{Reno2011}. \citeauthor{Reno2011} suggests that major forest losses toke place between 1950 and 1975 followed by lower annual deforestation till 2008. Located in the lower left part of the map crossing the borders of Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina is the Gran Chaco a hot semi-arid wooded grassland also known as tropical dry forest characterized by tree cover between approximately 29 and 49 thousand km$^2$ per hexagon and canopy densities between 28 and 46 \% \citep{Caldas2013}. The tropical rain forest is surrounded by tropical moist forest characterized by tree cover up to approximately 49 thousand km$^2$ per hexagon while the canopy density is between 10 and 82 \%.

Tropical rain forest in the center of the map is characterized by a tree cover between approximately 29 and 49 km$^2$ and canopy densities between 82 and 100 \%. The rain forest is surrounded by tropical moist forest with tree cover up to 49 km$^2$ but lower mean canopy densities between 10 and 82 \% as the rain forest. The tropical dry forest also known as Gran Chaco is located in the lower left of the map distributed over the countries Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina.}

			The figure \ref{fig:americas_loss} shows the distribution of tree cover losses over Latin America within the time frame of 2000 till 2010. During this period an area of approximately 388 thousand km$^2$ was deforested as table \ref{tab:proximate_driver} in the appendix \ref{ch:appendix_c} shows. We could identify for several countries deforestation hot-spots where the deforested area is between approximately 2.7 and 9 thousand km$^2$ as the map suggests. Tropical countries with deforestation hot-spots are: Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Guatemala. In Brazil the hot-spots of tree cover loss are known as arc of deforestation and cover the states of Acre, Rond\^{o}nia, Mato Grosso, and Pará while the deforestation starts to move into the state of Amazonas \citep{Wood2002}. The tree cover loss within this arc develops along the highway network in this regions \citep{Alves2002,Mueller2016}. Several paved highways like BR-163, BR-219, BR-230 etc. foster the agricultural and infrastructural development and lead to high deforestation rates. In Brazil an area of approximately 274 thousand km$^2$ is deforested between 2000 and 2010. Deforestation hot-spots in Paraguay and Argentina are located in the Gran Chaco region which was one of the least disturbed forests worldwide and is exposed to high deforestation rates since 1969 \citep{Caldas2013,Zak2004}. During our study time frame deforestation accounts for an area of approximately 7097 km$^2$ and 21 thousand km$^2$ in the Chaco region in Argentina and Paraguay, respectively. In Bolivia the deforestation hot-spot is located in the department of Santa Cruz. Bolivia had till the 1960s relative low deforestation rates which increased moderately after and increased sharply during the 1990s and remain high as the map suggests \citep{Pacheco2002,DavidKaimowitz2002}. During the first decade of 2000 an area of approximately 19 thousand km$^2$ is exposed to tree cover loss. The department of Petén in Guatemala is committed to deforestation since the 1980s \citep{Beach1998}. Since 2000 the deforestation rates in Guatemala are among the highest in Latin America and after 2005 the rates increased further \citep{McSweeney2014}. During 2000 and 2010 an area of approximately 6515 km$^2$ is exposed to tree cover loss as table \ref{tab:proximate_driver} shows. \citeauthor{McSweeney2014} highlights that deforestation hot-spots often spatially overlap with drug trafficking nodes. Especially in the department of Petén where large ranches are owned by narco-traffickers. In Peru deforestation hot-spots covering the provinces of Huánuco, Loreto, San Martin, and Ucayali, while the cumulative forest loss account for an area of approximately 8 thousand km$^2$ in the entire country. An area of approximately 15 thousand km$^2$ is exposed to deforestation in Colombia, while deforestation hot-spots are located in Cacquetá, Bolívar, and Antioquia.

			The map in figure \ref{fig:asia_tree_cover} shows the tree cover and canopy density distribution for Asia/Australia. In Asia the tropical rain forest is distributed over several southeast Asian islands like the Indonesian islands Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Papua etc., the Philippines, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea. Generally the rain forest is characterized by high tree covers comparable to Latin America but in our map most of the islands are smaller than a single hexagon. Therefore, by our method to compute the hexagon scaling the size of the polygons don't reflect the tree cover as share of the landmass and most of them appear smaller. The mean canopy density of tropical rain forest is between 82 and 100 \% and the tree cover is above approximately 9.9 km$^2$. Tropical moist and dry forest are distributed over the continental Asia covering the countries India, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos etc. These forests are characterized lower tree cover among 9.9 km$^2$ and canopy densities between 10 and 82 \% while the lower tree cover indicates that in southeast Asia deforestation occurs since the 1950s \citep{Kummer1994}.

			The map in figure \ref{fig:asia_loss} shows the distribution of tree cover loss in Asia/Australia for the time period 2000 till 2010. During this period a forest area of approximately 196 thousand km$^2$ is exposed to deforestation as table \ref{tab:proximate_driver} in the appendix \ref{ch:appendix_c} suggests. For this region we identified the following countries as deforestation hot-spots with deforestation areas per hexagon of approximately 1.9 to 9 thousand km$^2$: Indonesia, continental and insular Malaysia, Vietnam, and Laos. Indonesia is known as a country with one of the highest rates of primary forest loss for the time period 2000 till to 2016 \citep{Austin2019}. In the first decade of 2000 an area of approximately 100 thousand km$^2$ is exposed to deforestation as table \ref{tab:proximate_driver} suggests. Tree cover loss is predominantly distributed over the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo (Kalimantan) as the map \ref{fig:asia_loss} shows. Indonesia's forests are exposed to deforestation by dynamic causes since the 1950s \citep{Nawir2007}. Malaysia has lost an area of approximately thousand 33 km$^2$ by deforestation during the time frame 2000 till 2010. The deforestation hot-spots in Malaysia are distributed over the Malaysian Borneo (Sarawak/Sabah) and the continental Malaysia. Comparable to Indonesia, Malaysia's forests are exposed to deforestation since the 1950s by dynamic causes like logging followed by agricultural activities \citep{Kummer1994}. From 2000 till 2010 an area of approximately thousand km$^2$ was exposed to deforestation in Vietnam as table \ref{tab:proximate_driver} suggests. We identified the central highland provinces Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Gia Lai, and Lam Dong as deforestation hot-spots. \citet{Meyfroidt2013} confirms this in his study on trajectories of deforestation and highlights that the losses in this area could reduce the benefits of national-scale forest recovery. During the early 1990s a transition to reforestation was encouraged and natural forests expanded in Vietnam but it is connected with a increased loss in the highland regions \citep{Meyfroidt2013,Chazdon2008}. In Laos a forest area of approximately 8 thousand km$^2$ is lost during the time period 2000 till 2010. The map in figure \ref{fig:asia_loss} suggests that northern Laos is predominantly exposed to tree cover loss while \citet{Hirsch2000} confirms. Laos is known for a steady loss of forest cover since the early 1960s. Whereas the causes for this \ac{LC} transitions are dynamically changing till now.

			Figure \ref{fig:africa_tree_cover} shows the tree cover and canopy density distribution over Africa. In Africa the tropical rain forest is distributed over the following central African countries: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Cameroon, and partial in Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Liberia. In our map this type of forest is characterized by a dense tree cover between 39 and 49 thousand km$^2$ per hexagon while the canopy density between 64 and 100 \% does not separate it from the moist type as good as in Latin America and Asia/Australia. The rain forest is surrounded by tropical moist forest with a dense tree cover between 18 and 49 thousand km$^2$ while the mean canopy density between 10 and 82 \% is sparser then tropical rain forest. Countries covered by the moist tropical forest type are the following examples: Angola, Uganda, Central African Republic, Zambia, Madagascar etc. Tropical dry forest is characterized by a sparse tree cover among approximately 18 thousand km$^2$ per hexagon and canopy densities between 10 and 46 \%. Mozambique, Tanzania, and Nigeria are examples for countries covered partial by tropical dry forest.

The rain forest is surrounded by tropical moist forest with a dense tree cover as well but a lower mean canopy density between 10 and 82 \%.}

			The map in figure \ref{fig:africa_loss} shows the regions which are exposed to tree cover loss in Africa for the time period 2000 till 2010. During the first decade of 2000 an area of approximately 174 km$^2$ was deforested as table \ref{tab:proximate_driver} in the appendix \ref{ch:appendix_c} suggests. With tree cover loss between 1.1 and 3.7 thousand km$^2$ per hexagon we identified the following countries as deforestation hot-spots: Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, Mozambique, Madagascar, and Tanzania. At the Ivory Coast an area of approximately 10 thousand km$^2$ was exposed to deforestation between 2000 and 2010 as table \ref{tab:proximate_driver} shows. The map in figure \ref{fig:africa_loss} shows that the deforestation hot-spots are located in the southern and northern parts of the country. Evidences for this are given by \citet{Goetze2006} and \citet{Barima2016}. Lower deforestation in the center of the country can be explained by a military conflict started in 2002 that divides the country in a northern and southern zone with a buffer zone in between controlled by Un forces and French soldiers \citep{Barima2016}. At the Ivory coast continuous loss of tree cover by deforestation started approximately in the 1958s \citep{Chatelain1996}. The deforestation accounts for an area of approximately 45 thousand km$^2$ in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The DR Congo home of the second largest tropical forest in the world has compared to other tropical countries relatively low deforestation dynamics but recent studies show that deforestation could accelerate in the future \citep{Ickowitz2015}. The deforestation hot-spots are located in the eastern Congo and around medium-sized cities along the Congo river in the lower center of the country. During the first decade of the 2000s an area of about 13 thousand km$^2$ is deforested in Angola. Deforestation hot-spots are more oriented to the center of the country covering roughly the provinces Huambo, Bie, and Moxico as the map in figure \ref{fig:africa_loss} suggests. For the time period 1990 till 2009 \citet{Cabral2011} performed a study on forest change in the province of Huambo where a decrease in dense forest cover is observed while the cover of sparse forest is increasing \citep{Cabral2011}. Another study by \citet{Schneibel2017} on deforestation dynamics in south-central Angola reveals that the tree cover loss develops along anthropogenic infrastructure and forests are exploited over a long term until (fuel-wood collection etc.) a \ac{LC} transitions to other types like cropland occurs. To best of our knowledge no studies on historic deforestation dynamics exist for Angola due to the civil war from 1975 till 2002. In Mozambique an area of approximately 18 thousand km$^2$ was exposed to tree cover loss as table \ref{tab:proximate_driver} suggests. During the war between 1976 and 1992 the forests of Mozambique where not largely exposed to deforestation but since end of the war the deforestation rates are increasing \citep{Sitoe2012}. We identified the following provinces as deforestation hot-spots between 2000 and 2010: Zambezia, Nampula, and Cabo Delgado. This is largely confirmed by \citeauthor{Sitoe2012} where it is stated that deforestation is concentrated in the center and north of Mozambique. These hot-spots could be related to the higher population densities within this areas. Tree cover loss accounts for an area of about 11 thousand km$^2$ in Madagascar during the study period. In Madagascar deforestation hot-spots are concentrated at the north-east coast of the island as the map in figure \ref{fig:asia_loss} suggests. Madagascar's central highland forests are exposed to anthropogenic deforestation since 1600, reportedly \citep{Harper2007}. By the nineteenth century the deforestation advanced over the entire island forests. In Tanzania an area of approximately 14 thousand km$^2$ was exposed to tree cover loss. Since the 1900s approximately 19.4 \% of the forest cover is lost \citep{Kideghesho2015}. The map in figure \ref{fig:africa_loss} suggests that deforestation hot-spots are located in the country center covering the following provinces: Lindi, Singida, Tabora, Dodom, Tanga, Pwani, and the island of Zanzibar.

		\subsection{Proximate deforestation drivers}
		\label{subsec:results_proxy_deforestation_drivers}
			Our goal is to estimate the distribution of \acp{PDD} over the tropical zone, the continental range, and at a country scale for the time frame of 2000 till 2010. We achieved this estimate by superimposing the annual tree cover losses and aggregated gains of the \ac{GFC} datasets and the \ac{GL30} land cover map from 2000. We carefully selected our global definition of tree cover in the canopy density interval $(10,100]$ by applying the Jaccard Index and statistical testing detailed in section \ref{subsec:results_forest_definition}. By using this canopy density interval we filtered the \ac{GFC} annual losses and we considered tree cover gains only within previously lost tree cover. After superimposing we applied a reclassification of tree cover losses still classified as forest by the \ac{GL30} layer. We aggregated this structures by clustering and applied a square sized buffer of 500 meter side length. Next, we reclassified the structure by determining the highest frequent \ac{LC} class within the buffer. For further details on the \ac{PDD} prediction refer to section \ref{subsubsec:methods_proximate_deforestation_driver}. The \ac{PDD} distribution choropleth-maps for Latin America, Asia/Australia, and Africa we derived by applying our hexagonal-binning approach in combination with a hexagon-pie-chart. A hexagon in unscaled shape covers an area of 0.5 decimal degrees. Section \ref{subsec:methods_binning} describes detailed how we derived these cartograms. In the following paragraphs we will describe our results for Latin America, Asia/Australia, and Africa on continental and regional scale and close this section by discussing our results on global scale.

			In Latin America the transition of tree cover to cropland and pastures account for 21.3\% (95929.6 km$^2$) and 40.8\% (183841.4 km$^2$) as the table \ref{tab:proximate_driver} in the appendix \ref{ch:appendix_c} shows. Therefore, approximately 62\% (279771 km$^2$) of the tree cover were cleared for agricultural purposes in Latin America. Around 12.6\% (56909.3 km$^2$) of the tree cover loss is followed by tree cover regrowth, while the transition to shrubland account for 11.1\% (50260.2 km$^2$) of the tree cover loss, respectively. Minor \acp{PDD} are water, artificial surfaces, and bareland which account for 1.6\% (7169.9 km$^2$), 0.3\% (1561.5 km$^2$), and 0.1\% (405.4 km$^2$) of the forest transitions. \citet{Sy2015} estimates that agriculture accounts for 88.5\% of the tree cover loss, while transitions of forest cover to other \ac{LC} accounts for 11.5\%. Further, \citet{Hosonuma2012} achieve similar results for the conversion of tree cover to agricultural land where it accounts for approximately 90\% of the tree cover loss. Both studies estimate that the expansion of artificial surfaces account for approximately 1\% of the forest loss. The large difference could be explained by the definition of the forest transition classes in both studies. In both studies agriculture comprises pastures, cropland, and tree plantations. Additionally, both studies refer to the change of \ac{LU} and we determine the \acp{PDD} by the change of \ac{LC}. Further, \citeauthor{Sy2015} uses a sample based approach on 10x10 km \ac{FAO} FRA-2010 RSS data which could yield overestimates, while \citeauthor{Hosonuma2012} uses an empirical approach based on \ac{FAO} data as well. A recent study on \acp{PDD} estimates that commodity-driven deforestation, shifting agriculture, forestry, wildfire, and urbanization account for 56\%, 31\%, 13\%, 1\%, and <1\% of the tee cover loss, respectively \citep{Curtis2018}. Commodity-driven deforestation refers to tree cover loss as long-term permanent transition of forest to a non-forest \ac{LU} like agriculture which includes cropland, pastures, plantations and so forth. Comparable to the previously mentioned research on \acp{PDD} the difference between our estimates and \citeauthor{Curtis2018} arise from class definitions. If we would aggregate our \ac{LC} classes to their schema it would yield nearly the same results. In particular the same estimate for tree cover loss by urbanization shows that the similar classes without aggregation yield similar results. In Latin America the \ac{LC} change to cropland is mainly distributed over southern part, while the transition to pastures is concentrated in the central part of the continent as figure \ref{fig:americas_driver} suggests. Cropland expansion mainly took place in the south of Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, and Bolivia, while forest loss by pasture expansion is concentrated in the center and north of Brazil. The spatial distribution of cropland/pasture dynamics largely corresponds to the findings of \citet{Graesser2015}. Large quantities of tree cover regrowth can be observed in the south-east and center of Latin America namely the southeast coast of Brazil and within the tropical rain forest covering Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. In south-east Brazil the findings of \citeauthor{Curtis2018} suggests that the regrowth dynamics are driven by forestry actions, while the coastline is exposed to shifting agriculture. Cropland and pasture expansion account for 19.1\% and 49.7\% of the tree cover loss, while regrowth dynamics and artificial surfaces account for 11.8\% and 0.3\% of the tree cover loss in Brazil. Figure \ref{fig:americas_driver} shows that deforestation by cropland expansion is mainly concentrated in the southern part of Brazil in the provinces Mato Grosso, Goi\'{a}s, and Mato Grosso do Sul, which is largely confirmed by \citet{Zalles2018} and \citet{Graesser2015}. Additionally, in the northern part of Mato Grosso and the southern part of Mato Grosso do Sul deforestation by grassland expansion can be observed \citep{Graesser2015,Sy2015}. The tree cover loss in the arc of deforestation can be attributed to pasture expansion, which is confirmed by \citet{Sy2015} and \citet{Graesser2015}. For the Chaco region of Paraguay the main \ac{PDD} is the expansion of cropland, which accounts for 48.9\% of the tree cover loss. The findings of \citet{Graesser2015} and \citet{Caldas2013} suggest that the main \ac{PDD} in this region is the expansion of pastures, while findings by \citet{Graesser2018} suggests that pastures are largely replaced by cropland \ac{LU} between 1990 and 2015. Therefore, the initial cause for tree cover loss could be the expansion of pastures but the \ac{LU} changed already to cropland at our image date of 2010. In the Argentinian part of the Chaco cultivated and grassland account for 65.8\% and 5.3\% of the tree cover loss. This could also be observed by \citet{Sy2015}. In Bolivia cropland and pasture expansion account for 37.2\% and 22.4\% of the forest loss, while transitions of forest cover to artificial surfaces account for 0.4\% of the tree cover loss, respectively. Main \ac{PDD} for the deforestation hot-spot in the province Santa Cruz is the expansion of cropland as figure \ref{fig:americas_driver} suggests. Further, in north Bolivia and at the Brazilian border the deforestation is driven by pasture expansion. Both patterns are largely confirmed by \citet{Graesser2015} and \citet{Sy2015}. In Guatemala cropland, pasture, and artificial expansion account for 23.9\%, 38.6\%, 0.5\% of the forest loss, respectively. The main \acp{PDD} for the deforestation hot-spot in the province of Peten are pasture expansion followed by cropland expansion as the map \ref{fig:americas_driver} suggests. Pasture expansion is the main force for deforestation in south of Guatemala. Regrowth dynamics in Guatemala which account for 12\% of the forest loss could be attributed to the establishment of oil palm plantations and shifting agriculture \citep{Furumo2017,Curtis2018}.
			In Peru cropland, pasture, and artificial expansion account for 6.6\%, 23\%, and 0.2\% of the forest loss, while regrowth dynamics account for 28.2\% of the forest loss, respectively. \citep{Sy2015} crop expansion, \citep{Vijay2018,Furumo2017} oil palm in the center of peru

			For Asia/Australia the table \ref{tab:proximate_driver} in the appendix \ref{ch:appendix_c} shows cultivated and grassland account for 16\% (36819.3 km$^2$) and 7.1\% (16302.6 km$^2$) of the tree cover loss, respectively. Therefore, the transition of \ac{LC} to agriculture usage accounts for 23.1\% (53121.9 km$^2$) of the tree cover losses. The transition of tree cover to artificial surfaces and the forest loss by inundation by lakes and rivers account for 1.1\% (2431.9 km$^2$) and 0.4\% (890 km$^2$), respectively. In Asia/Australia the largest \ac{PDD} is the regrowth which accounts for 61.2\% (140653.4 km$^2$) of the cumulative tree cover loss. Forest transitions to shrubland account for 6.7 \% (), respectively. \citet{Hosonuma2012} estimates that \ac{LC} transitions by agriculture account for approximately 70\% of the forest loss, while \citet{Curtis2018} estimates that commodity-driven deforestation, shifting agriculture, forestry, wildfire, and urbanization account for 13\%, 78\%, 9\%, 13\%, <1\%, and <1\% of the tree cover loss in Southeast Asia, respectively. As mentioned in the previous paragraph the differences in \acp{PDD} estimates relate mainly to the applied methodology and the aggregation of \ac{LC} classes. The figure \ref{fig:asia_driver} shows an overview of the \acp{PDD} distribution in Asia/Australia and indicates that regrowth dynamics are largely concentrated at the east of Asia/Australia namely in the following countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Papua New Guinea. Conversion of tree cover to cropland can be observed in Vietnam, Cambodia, the north of Thailand, and India in its entire extent. \note{Reference Curtis for spatial patterns}

			In Africa the table \ref{tab:proximate_driver} in the appendix \ref{ch:appendix_c} suggests that cropland and grassland account for 22.8\% (44289.5 km$^2$) and 46\% (89301.4 km$^2$) of the tree cover loss, respectively. Therefore, transitions to agricultural land are the major \ac{PDD} in Africa and account for 68.8\% (133590.9 km$^2$) of the tree cover loss. Forest transitions to water, artificial surfaces, and bareland account for 1.2\% (2409.9 km$^2$), 0.6\% (1238.6 km$^2$), and 0.1\% (146 km$^2$) of the tree cover loss, respectively. In Africa on 17\% (32980.8 km$^2$) of the area exposed to tree cover loss regrowth could be detected, while the transition to shrubland account for 3.4\% (6599.5 km$^2$) of the tree cover loss, respectively. The study on \acp{PDD} by \citet{Hosonuma2012} estimates that agriculture and urbanization account for approximately 75\% and 2\% of the tree cover loss, respectively. For Africa \citet{Curtis2018} shows that commodity-driven deforestation, shifting agriculture, forestry, wildfire, and urbanization account for 4\%, 92\%, 4\%, <1\%, <1\% of the tree cover loss.

			In Latina America and Africa the major \ac{PDD} is grassland, while in Asia/Australia it is regrowth. 

			On the global range the major \acp{PDD} are cropland and pastures which account for 20.2\% (177038.5 km$^2$) and 33.1\% (289445.5 km$^2$) as the table \ref{tab:proximate_driver} in the appendix \ref{ch:appendix_c} suggests. 

		\subsection{Accuracy assessment}
		\label{subsec:results_accuracy_assessment}
		%TODO review: switch to good english
			\note{Goal (review):} Goal is the assessment of the accuracy of our proximate deforestation driver predictions. We created a set of ground truth data by sampling our proximate deforestation driver layers. In each continental region we select per random 10 tiles and draw 200 samples per tile. The 200 samples comprises pixels over the full value range of our proximate deforestation driver classes. We imported the prepared sample to our JavaScript application and subsequently classified each sample with a label by visual interpretation of google earth imagery. To determine the accuracy we used a confusion matrix and the derived metrics.

			\note{Results (review):} Table \ref{tab:results_confusion_matrix} shows the confusion matrix to determine the accuracy of our predictions where the term reference refers to the labeling of pixel by our visual interpretation and predictions refer to the labeling of our proximate driver predictions. The abbreviations PAc, UAc, OvAc, Com, Om, Tot, and Kappa refer to the terms Producers-Accuracy, Users-Accuracy, Overall-Accuracy, Error of Commission, Error of Omission, row or column total, and Kappa Coefficient. From the 6000 samples we draw from our study extent 14 \%, 20 \%, 22 \%, 32 \%, 8 \%, 2 \%, 0.5 \%, 2 \%, and 0.5 \% account for cultivated land (10), tree cover (20), regrowth (25), shrubland (40), wetland (50), water (60), artificial land (80), and bareland (90), respectively. Our method predicts a distribution of 15 \%, 18 \%, 27 \%, 31 \%, 7 \%, 1 \%, 0.8 \%, 1 \%, and 0.2 \% for the land cover classes 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, and 90, respectively.
			Highest producers accuracy is achieved the regrowth class with 88 percent. The prediction of this class was achieved by including global forest change gain data within our target canopy density. During building our reference data set per visual interpretation we determined this class by following these rules. We checked the surroundings and the corresponding pixel for signs of road networks and infrastructure. Further we checked if the canopy shows signs of age class forest and line patterns which show the establishment of artificial introduced forest cover. During the visual interpretation we recognized that a large portion of the regrowth class is occupied by plantations especially in Americas and Asia. For Asia a major share was occupied by palm oil or other plantations. It must be mentioned that here the deforestation within our temporal frame is not coercively the clearing of natural cover/primary forest it shows it shows also rotational cycles of deforestation reforestation.
			The second highest accuracy with 85 (producers accuracy) was achieved in the prediction of cultivated land where only 15 percent could be identified as error of commission. 8.2 percent are classified as forest or regrowth which could reveal zones of shifting agriculture or temporal issues. To identify this class during our visual interpretation we applied nearly the same rules as the detection of regrowth checking for infrastructure but here no canopy should be identified. Further we checked for large scale square patterns which is shown by large scale commodity driven agriculture. Especially the small scale agriculture was hard detect because these class of agriculture often show no regular patterns of forest clearing and are often accompanied by selective logging. Further it should be mentioned common practice of small scale agriculture is inhomogeneous over the regions Americas, Asia and Africa. Another good indicator for cultivated land is the appearance of tillage patterns on high resolution imagery. Cultivated land comprises a large variety of different use cases. 
			Grassland shows an accuracy of 77 at an error of commission of 23 percent. The error could lead back to classification errors by GlobeLand30 or land cover change dynamics and the temporal time frame. For visual interpretation cultivated land and grassland share some common properties like square shaped clearings and infrastructure in the surroundings. But grassland is also defined by the occurrence of shrubs and single trees within its extent. To really determine the differences between both classes high resolution imagery is required. In Americas the grassland patches could often be identified as used for cattle ranching. During visual interpretation we recognized frequently the occurrence of water holes. Africa showed the occurrence of natural grasslands and Asia bla.

	\section{Emissions}
		\note{Goal (review):} Our goal is to estimate the emissions emitted by proximate deforestation driver. We estimated the emissions from the removal of aboveground biomass and through the change of soil organic carbon content. Detailed below are the pdd classes we assumed as deforestation to estimate the agb emissions: 10, 25, 30, 40, 80, 90. To approximate the emissions by soil organic carbon change we used the transition pathways from don et al. We estimated soc for two different scenarios with the following conditions: scenario one (SC1) all transitions occur in primary forest and scenario two (SC2) by using the intact forest landscape layer we distinguished between primary forest and secondary forest. The first scenario can be seen as liberal estimate and the second scenario as conservative estimate. We aggregated our results on global and continental scale. 

	\section{Ecosystem service values}
		Our goal is to estimate the monetary loss of \ac{ESV} by the aggregated \ac{PDD} at a global and continental scale between 2001 and 2010. Whereas a study targeting regional scale aggregation could easily performed with our data. Additionally, we approximated the monetary gain if the former tree cover is converted to a certain type of \ac{LC}. We refer to this gain as \ac{ESV} gain. Further, we compute the balance between \ac{ESV} loss and gain to estimate the net change of \ac{ESV} in the tropical zone. We applied three datasets which estimate the monetary value of ecosystems on a global scale namely the following data: \citet{Groot2012}, \citet{Costanza2014}, and \citet{Siikamaki2015}. We refer to this datasets as Co, Dg, and Wb. To compute the monetary loss of \ac{ESV} we selected the following \ac{PDD} classes as anthropogenic deforestation: cultivated land (10), regrowth (25), grassland (30), shrubland (40), artificial surfaces (80), and bareland (90). We excluded pixel classified as forest (20) by our \ac{PDD} prediction because within this class we are uncertain if a deforestation event occurred. Further, we excluded transitions to wetland or water bodies because we assume this \ac{LC} changes are largely driven by natural causes. The cumulative \ac{ESV} gain depends on the particular \ac{ESV} dataset because the datasets don't define a monetary value for each \ac{PDD} class. For detailed informations on the methodology refer to section \ref{subsec:methods_esv}. The \ac{ESV} net change or balance is the difference of cumulative \ac{ESV} loss and gain. The monetary unit for each value is the Geary–Khamis dollar at 2007 per year also known as international dollar (2007 Int.\$ y$^{-1}$). The table \ref{tab:esv_results} shows the gross \ac{ESV} loss and gain and the net balance for continental and global scale. We will discuss the \ac{ESV} losses exclusively for the Co and Wb datasets because the difference between Co and Dg is just 118 international dollar per year. Further, we discuss the \ac{ESV} gain for all three datasets because they provide a range of different estimates per biome.

		In Latin America a forest loss of approximately 396 thousand km$^2$ accounts for 208.3, 204, or 51 billion 2007 Int'I\$ y$^{-1}$ of \ac{ESV} loss as table \ref{tab:esv_results} suggests. By applying the \citet{Costanza2014} monetary value for tropical forest the transition of tree cover to cropland accounts for a loss of 51 billion Int'I\$ y$^{-1}$, while transitions to pastures account for a loss of approximately 126 billion dollar per year. The tropical deforestation by the expansion of artificial and bareland surfaces account for a loss of 1 billion Int'I\$ y$^{-1}$, while regrowth dynamics convert to a loss of 30 billion dollar. By using the monetary value of tropical forest from \citet{Siikamaki2015} the transitions to cropland and pastures cost 12.6 and 30.6 billion dollar, respectively. Further, the aggregated urbanization and bareland transition accounts for 0.3 billion dollar per year, while regrowth dynamics account for 7.5 billion international dollar per year. The variability in the estimates is related to the difference of monetary value for tropical forest between both datasets. \citeauthor{Costanza2014} monetary prediction for tropical forest is approximately 4 times greater than \citeauthor{Siikamaki2015}. We estimated a gross monetary gain of 161 billion dollar per year for the Co dataset. The table \ref{tab:esv_mapping} in section \ref{subsec:methods_esv} suggests that we calculated the monetary gain from \ac{LC} transitions to cropland, grassland, artificial surfaces, and regrowth which account for 53.4, 76.6, 1, and 30.6 billion dollar per year, respectively. By applying \citet{Groot2012} \ac{ESV} estimates the gross gain from \ac{LC} transitions account for 82.5 billion dollar per year. This converts to a monetary gain from grassland and regrowth transitions of approximately 52.8 and 29.9 billion dollar. The last dataset we tested enabled us to compute only the \ac{ESV} gain from tree cover regrowth which accounts for a monetary gain of 7.3 billion dollar per year, respectively. In Latin America the net balance of \ac{ESV} changes account for -47.3, -121.5, and -43.7 billion dollar for Co, Dg, and Wb, respectively. The negative signs indicates that overall three datasets the we could observe a net loss of \ac{ESV} in Latin America for the time period 2000 till 2010. The highest net loss can be observed for the Dg dataset but this relate to the small number of \ac{LC} transitions defined by a monetary value.

		For our study period in Asia/Australia tree cover loss of approximately 230 thousand km$^2$ accounts for an \ac{ESV} loss of 111.6, 109.1, or 27.2 billion dollar per year for the three datasets as table \ref{tab:esv_results} shows. The first dataset predicts that forest cover transitions to cultivated- and grassland account for a loss of 19.8 and 9.8 billion dollar per year, respectively. Further, the expansion of artificial surfaces account for a loss of 0.5 billion dollar, while the regrowth dynamics account for a loss of approximately 75.7 billion dollar per year. By applying the monetary \ac{ESV} estimate for tropical forest of \citet{Siikamaki2015} cropland and pastures account for a loss of 4.8 and 2.4 billion dollar per year, respectively. The transition of forest cover to artificial surfaces account for 0.2 billion dollar, while regrowth dynamics account for 18.4 billion dollar. In regards of \ac{ESV} gain dynamics and by applying the first dataset cropland and pastures account for a monetary gain of 20.5 and 6.8 billion dollar per year, respectively. Further \ac{LC} transitions to regrowth and artificial surfaces account for a gain of 75.7 and 0.5 billion dollar. By considering \citet{Groot2012} estimates grassland and regrowth account for a gain of approximately 4.6 and 74 billion dollar per year, respectively. By applying the last dataset in table \ref{tab:esv_results} regrowth account for a gain of 19.4 billion dollar per year. In summary by applying the three datasets we estimated a \ac{ESV} gain of 80.6, 43.1, and 4.3 billion dollar per year, respectively. In regards of the net \ac{ESV} balance in Asia/Australia the three datasets account for a net loss of -2.5, -26, and -7.8 billion dollar per year, respectively. The low net losses can be explained by the high share of regrowth for this region. In Asia/Australia the high share of regrowth could be the establishment of plantations or the rotational cycle as management practice of existing plantations as explained in the section \ref{subsec:results_proxy_deforestation_drivers} on \acp{PDD}. It is to assume that if we would use for regrowth the monetary value of cultivated land from the first dataset the net balance could have a positive sign.

		For Africa the table \ref{tab:esv_results} shows that a tree cover loss of approximately 177 km$^2$ account for a \ac{ESV} loss of 94.2, 92.1, and 22.9 billion dollar per year for the three datasets, respectively. For the first dataset tree cover losses by cultivated- and grassland expansion convert to a loss of 23.7 and 51.5 billion dollar, while the expansion of artificial surfaces account for 0.7 billion dollar. In Africa regrowth dynamics are responsible for a loss of approximately 17.7 billion dollar per year. By applying the monetary value for tropical forest of \citet{Siikamaki2015} cropland and pasture expansion account for a loss if 5.8 and 12.7 billion dollar per year, respectively. The transition to artificial surfaces account for 0.2 billion dollar, while regrowth dynamics account for a loss of 4.3 billion dollar. The monetary gain by \ac{LC} transitions account for 80.6, 43.1, and 4.3 billion dollar per year, respectively. For the Co-dataset the forest transition to cropland, pastures, artificial surfaces, and regrowth dynamics account for 24.6, 37.2, 0.8, and 17.7 billion dollar of the total \ac{ESV} gain. By applying the second dataset grassland and regrowth dynamics account for a gain of 25.6 and 17.4 billion dollar, while the last dataset estimates a gain of approximately 4.3 billion dollar for regrowth dynamics. In Africa the net balance is negative and account for a net loss of -13.6, -49, and -18.6 billion dollar overall datasets.

		The highest \ac{ESV} losses can be observed in Latin America followed by Asia/Australia and Africa. This \ac{ESV} loss dynamic is mainly attributed to the large area deforested in Latin America. If we normalize the Co \ac{ESV} gain by dividing the gross gain by the assumed cumulative anthropogenic deforestation the normalized gain account for 414, 553, and 462 thousand Int'I\$ y$^{-1}$ km$^{-2}$ for Latin America, Asia/Australia, and Africa, respectively. Therefore, the highest \ac{ESV} gain per deforested km$^2$ of tropical forest can be observed in Asia/Australia followed by Africa, while Latin America has the lowest \ac{ESV} gain per km$^2$. This can be attributed to the large share of regrowth dynamics in Asia/Australia. In Africa the \ac{ESV} gain is mainly driven by large share of agricultural transitions and regrowth dynamics. The \ac{ESV} net losses are smallest in Asia/Australia followed by Africa, while Latin America has the greatest net losses. Differences in \ac{ESV} estimates between the datasets of \citet{Costanza2014}, \citet{Groot2012}, and \citet{Siikamaki2015} are mainly attributed to the completeness of biomes represented and the valuation. For \ac{ESV} loss estimates of tropical forest the difference between Co and Dg is marginal, while the completeness of the Co dataset outranks the Dg coefficients.

		Between 2000 and 2010 on a global scale tree cover loss of approximately 772 thousand km$^2$ accounts for a \ac{ESV} loss of 414.1, 405.2, and 101.1 billion dollar per year as table \ref{tab:esv_results} shows. By applying the \ac{ESV} coefficient for tropical forest from \citet{Costanza2014} the expansion of cropland and pastures account for a loss of approximately 95.3 and 128 billion dollar per year, respectively. The transition of forest cover to artificial surfaces and regrowth dynamics account for 2.3 and 124 billion dollar per year. If we consider the monetary value of tropical forest from \citet{Siikamaki2015} cropland, grassland, artificial surfaces, and regrowth dynamics account for a loss of approximately 23.2, 46.7, 0.5, and 30.2 billion dollar per year, respectively. The gross gain in \ac{ESV} from \ac{LC} transitions of tropical forest cover accounts for 350.6, 208.7, and 31.0 billion dollar per for the three datasets. By using the coefficients from the first dataset cropland, pastures, artificial surfaces, and regrowth dynamics account for a gain of 98.5, 120.6, 2.4, and 124.1 billion dollar per year, respectively. If we consider \citet{Groot2012} grassland and regrowth account for a gain of 83 and 121 billion dollar per year, while regrowth dynamics account for a gain of approximately 31 billion dollar for the last dataset. On global scale the net balance of tropical forest change account for -63.5, -196, and -70.1 billion dollar per year for the three datasets Co, Dg, and Wb, respectively. The greatest net loss can be observed by applying \citeauthor{Groot2012} \ac{ESV} coefficients which could be mainly attributed to the small number of \acp{PDD} classes which correspond to a evaluated \ac{ESV} biome. The relative small net loss in \ac{ESV} by using the coefficients from the first dataset is attributed on the fact that approximately a fifth of the global tree cover is lost by the expansion of cropland. \citeauthor{Costanza2014} estimates 5567 Int'I\$ y$^{-1}$ as the \ac{ESV} for cropland which is 1.03 times greater than the \ac{ESV} of tropical forest. Further, nearly a quarter of tropical forest cover is exposed to regrowth dynamics which uses the equivalent \ac{ESV} as tropical tree cover. Therefore, approximately a half of the tropical forest loss is replaced by \ac{LC} which has a greater or equal \ac{ESV} than the \ac{ESV} of tropical forest. For the time frame 2000 till 2012 \citet{Song2018} estimates that the net loss of tropical forest cover accounts for a \ac{ESV} loss of 550.7 billion dollar per year. The difference between our \ac{ESV} loss can be attributed to discrepancies in \ac{LC} change estimates, forest definition, and temporal resolution. \citeauthor{Song2018} considered the tree cover loss in all canopy densities and used for his net loss estimate tree cover gains within former forested area and the establishment of new tree cover. Further, \citet{Costanza2014} estimates that tropical forest loss account for a \ac{ESV} loss of 3.5 trillion dollar per year between 1997 and 2011, \note{LOL sorry but this is somehow a huge overestimate}.
