    "The whole processing pipeline over the entire notebooks represent the approach to process the data which is discussed in my master thesis. Furthermore, the explanations and descriptions in each notebook are equal to the content of my master thesis particularly the sections Data and Methodology as well as Results. Indeed the following notebooks are my master thesis, so that you have the choice between passively reading a book alike document or interactively discovering my evolved approach and exploring the results by yourself.\n",

    "You should read as well as execute the notebooks labeled by increasing numbers in the suggested order. If you refuse to follow this suggestion, I can not ensure that the processing pipeline executes in the supposed manner. Commonly, you must execute the code cells top-down in each notebook but the proper usage is described in each notebook. Eventually, the entire processing pipeline encompass the following notebooks:\n",

    "[**2 Data acquisition**](2 Data acquisition.ipynb) provides the download of several datasets  which are required for the processing pipeline. Furthermore, this notebook offer a comprehensive explanation on each dataset and points out the pivotal roll in the processing pipeline. After, you successfully accomplished this section, your local machine stores the necessary data properly prepared for the further processing and you may proceed with the next section. \n",

    "For convenience these *Jupyter* notebooks uses several extensions from the repository [*nbextensions*](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/) on *Github*. Please, follow carefully the provided installation instructions, and subsequently activate the support of *LaTeX* environments for *Jupyter* and the table of contents extension in the *nbextensions* configuration overview. Further, it should be mentioned that the *LaTeX* environment support for *Jupyter* requires a pre-installed *LaTeX* runtime environment. Hence, you must install your preferred *LaTeX* runtime, if you want to have a  convenient formatted bibliography in each notebook.   \n",

    "In order to attain a successful execution of the processing pipeline you must ensure that a installation of  *Python 3.5* or later is available on your local machine. Indeed, the entire code of this processing pipeline is written OS independent in order to execute it similarly on *Linux*, *Windows* or *MacOS*, so you must not care about compatibility issues. As next, the processing pipeline of this project requires several packages which are not provided by the standard library. Therefore, these packages must be installed which is most convenient with the provided [*requirements.txt*](requirements.txt) file and the command `pip install -r <path-to-requirements-file>`. Eventually, you must install the following packages by yourself if you decline to use the requirements file:\n",
